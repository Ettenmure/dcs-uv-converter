## Usage

### Exporting the UV map in Model Viewer

On the Model Viewer, load the model of your choosing.

### Converting the UV map to an image in Blender

On the Properties editor, at the right of the screen, change to the "Scene" tab.

Here you should see an entry called "DCS UV Converter", expand it to reveal the "Convert .csv" button.

Click the grey "Convert .csv" button. A new window will open asking you to locate on your hard drive the .csv file that you previously created.
Select it and press the blue "Import .csv" button.

The conversion process has now begun, this can last from seconds to minutes depending on the complexity of the UV map and your computer hardware. 
Do not exit Blender while it's running.

Once it finishes you will be notified on the outliner editor, at the top right of the screen, with a new collection appearing called "Conversion finished".

The conversion process has now finished, exit Blender.

The generated UV map is an image in .svg format that will be located at the same folder as the .csv. Its name has "_UV" added at the end.

## Troubleshooting

**The Add-on fails to install**

- Try a manual installation. Extract the .zip file and move the folder named "DCSUVConverter", which contains "\_\_init\_\_.py", to:

  C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.93\scripts\addons

  If you have never installed an Add-on before you might not have the "scripts" or "addons" folders and you will have to create them manually.

  Next open Blender, or refresh the menu if it was already open, and on the Add-ons menu search for DCS.
  Activate the Add-on by clicking on the checkbox to the left of the Add-on name.

**The Add-on is installed but there is no "DCS UV Converter" at the scene tab**

- The Add-on might not have been activated. Confirm that the checkbox to the left of the Add-on name in the Add-ons menus is active.
